## Data Cleaning and Transformation 
Two dataset was provided for this project which are the **_ActualSales data_** and **_Target data_**. The following data cleaning was done on the dataset as this will help in getting accurate results for our visualisation. 

-  Append Queries: Append queries was done for the Actualsales 2022 and the Actual sales 2023 - 2025
-  ETL file was created for tables that will not be loaded into the power Bi.
-  Target dataset
  .  Unpivote the year columns
  .  The the value column to Target Qty in the Formula bar
  .  Merge the month/Year column
-  Data type was changed
-  Making first row as header was done on all of the dataset table
-  Because there is no relationship btween the channel table and the sales table, the channel table was merged withe the subchannel column as this will help with a better relation model.

## Modelling:
The best type of model in power Bi is the star schema, an automatically derived dimension table was adjusted to remove and replace unwanted relationship.

Auto model             |       Adjusted-model

The model is a star schema.
There are 5 dimenstion tables and 2 fact tables. The dimension tables are all joined to the fact tables with one-to-many- relationship.

1.  Sales Overview
2.  Marketing Performance

â€¢ Here are ideas of how these reports will be used:
The Sales Representative can track their performances through-out the periods to plan their marketing activities.
The Team Managers can track their teams' performances through-out the periods to plan their teams' activities.
Executive team can track Revenue numbers to monitor alignment with the set targets to influence medium to long term strategies.
Note: You are to use the company's standard colors across your reports. You will find the Logo and Color guides in the Assets Folder you can download in the next lesson.
