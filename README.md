## Data Cleaning and Transformation 
Two dataset was provided for this project which are the **_ActualSales data_** and **_Target data_**. The following data cleaning was done on the dataset as this will help in getting accurate results for our visualisation. 

## Modelling:
The best type of model in power Bi is the star schema, an automatically derived dimension table was adjusted to remove and replace unwanted relationship.

Adjusted model   |    Auto-model

The model is a star schema.
There are 5 dimenstion tables and 2 fact tables. The dimension tables are all joined to the fact table with one-to-many- relationship.

â€¢ Here are ideas of how these reports will be used:

The Sales Representative can track their performances through-out the periods to plan their marketing activities.
The Team Managers can track their teams' performances through-out the periods to plan their teams' activities.
Executive team can track Revenue numbers to monitor alignment with the set targets to influence medium to long term strategies.
Note: You are to use the company's standard colors across your reports. You will find the Logo and Color guides in the Assets Folder you can download in the next lesson.
